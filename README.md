This is an cab booking code written in python.

Here for cab drivers I've kept static positions but while using it for Back-end I'll be using the drivers live location from the api's and generate their locations in live.

I've used file handling for storing the user signup and login info in simple txt format.

They can be replaced by json data's from server while using this in server-side!

First you'll signup or login and then either you can type your current location or click on current location it'll automatically choose your live location using geocode.

Then enter the destination.. After entering it'll show the distance between these places.

Then it'll show cab drivers nearby within 25kms radius.

Lastly if you cancel your booking then you'll need to start from first!!

                                                Thanks Again!
